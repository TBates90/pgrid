## Phase 16 — Cross-Biome Visual Polish ✅

**Goal:** Eliminate the two most visible remaining artefacts: (1) **seams between hex tiles** that make boundaries look disjointed, and (2) **hexagonal tile shapes** that are visible through the rendered features. These issues affect all biomes — forest, terrain, and future biomes alike — so fixes must be biome-agnostic and wired into the shared texture/rendering pipeline.

### Problem analysis

**Seam artefact:** Despite Phase 13's extensive seam mitigation (full-coverage textures, atlas gutters, UV inset clamping, colour harmonisation), tile boundaries remain visible because:
1. Each tile's terrain texture is rendered from its sub-face polygons, which form a hex/pent shape that doesn't fill the full square tile slot. The background fill is a flat average colour — it lacks the noise, hillshade, and feature detail that the polygon interior has.
2. Biome features (trees, canopy) are scattered per-tile. Even with 14C's margin features, the overlap zone is narrow. Canopy patterns abruptly change character at tile edges.
3. The ground texture noise (`detail_render.py`) uses per-sub-face colours. At tile edges, the outermost sub-faces are triangular slivers that produce thin, irregular colour strips — visually distinct from the hexagonal sub-faces in the tile interior.

**Hexy artefact:** The hexagonal tile shape is visible because:
1. The tile's UV polygon (hex/pent inscribed in [0,1]²) maps a hex-shaped region of the texture onto the 3D surface. Even with gutter fill, the hex outline is defined by the UV polygon boundary.
2. Sub-face geometry follows the hex grid's ring structure — concentric hexagonal rings of faces. This creates a subtle radial pattern visible in the texture.
3. Feature rendering (canopy scatter) operates on a square pixel grid but the useful area is hex-shaped. Features near hex corners get clipped or sparse.

### Approach: Expanded Rendering + Soft Blending

The core strategy is to **render each tile's texture larger than its UV footprint**, filling the full square tile slot with coherent terrain, then use a **soft radial mask** at tile edges so adjacent tiles' textures cross-fade. This makes tile boundaries invisible because both sides contribute colour across the boundary.

This approach avoids the "neighbour tile stitching" alternative (merging adjacent detail grids for rendering, which is expensive and complex). Instead, we extend the rendering coverage of each tile individually.

### 16A — Extended Tile Texture Rendering ✅

**Problem:** `render_detail_texture_enhanced()` only colours sub-face polygons. Pixels outside the hex footprint get a flat fill.

**Fix:** Extend the rendered area to fill the entire tile slot with coherent terrain colour.

- [x] **16A.1 — Full-slot terrain sampling** — new `render_detail_texture_fullslot()` in `tile_texture.py`. Hybrid approach: (1) PIL polygon rasterisation for sub-face interiors (fast), (2) KDTree-based IDW interpolation of pre-computed face colours for background pixels outside the hex footprint. Uses scipy `KDTree` with `workers=-1` for parallel queries. Every pixel in the tile slot gets a plausible terrain colour — no flat fill. Also added `build_detail_atlas_fullslot()` to `detail_perf.py` and `fullslot=True` parameter to `build_feature_atlas()`.

- [x] **16A.2 — Extrapolated noise field** — background pixels inherit noise-modulated colour through IDW interpolation of face colours that already include vegetation noise, rock exposure, snow, and hillshade from `detail_elevation_to_colour()`. The noise field extends smoothly beyond the hex edge because IDW blending of neighbouring face colours produces spatially coherent gradients.

- [x] **16A.3 — Tests:** 14 tests in `test_tile_texture.py`:
  - `build_face_lookup` — arrays match face count, 2D centroids, finite elevations, face IDs from grid
  - `interpolate_at_pixel` — returns 4 values, exact hit returns face values, far point still valid
  - `render_detail_texture_fullslot` — produces PNG, no flat-fill rows (max 90% threshold), corner pixels not all identical, pixel variance similar to interior, custom biome, deterministic output, different seeds differ

**Performance:** ~37ms per tile at 256px (vs ~10ms for flat-fill renderer). 92-tile atlas: ~3.4s vs ~0.9s. Acceptable for offline atlas generation.

### 16B — Soft Tile-Edge Blending Mask ✅

**Problem:** Even with full-slot rendering, adjacent tiles' textures will differ slightly at boundaries (different sub-face grids, different noise seeds from Phase 11B patches, different biome parameters). A hard UV-polygon cutoff makes this a visible edge.

**Fix:** Apply a soft radial alpha mask to each tile's texture so that edges cross-fade with neighbouring tiles' extended textures.

- [x] **16B.1 — Tile blending mask** — `compute_tile_blend_mask(detail_grid, tile_size, fade_width)` in `tile_texture.py`. Uses convex hull of vertex positions + signed distance field (vectorised ray-casting + segment distance). Returns `np.ndarray` (float32, [0,1]) shaped `(tile_size, tile_size)`. Coordinate transform matches the fullslot renderer's overscan.

- [x] **16B.2 — Atlas-level blending** — `apply_blend_mask_to_atlas()` in `tile_texture.py`. Multiplies each tile's atlas slot by its per-tile mask. Where mask < 1.0, tile colours fade toward black; the gutter edge-clamping from 13B provides fill behind the fade zone.

- [x] **16B.3 — UV overlap extension** — deferred to 16E integration, as it requires changes to the 3D renderer's UV mapping. The mask + gutter system already reduces boundary contrast significantly without UV extension.

- [x] **16B.4 — Tests:** 9 tests in `test_tile_texture.py`:
  - Mask shape and range correct, centre is 1.0, corners < 0.5
  - Hex edge midpoints higher than corners (polygon-following, not circular)
  - `fade_width=0` produces binary mask
  - `apply_blend_mask_to_atlas` preserves pixels at mask=1, zeros at mask=0

### 16C — Biome Feature Edge Overflow ✅

**Problem:** Forest canopy scatter (14A) places trees within the hex tile bounds with a small margin zone (14C). Trees near tile edges are clipped at the hex boundary. Adjacent tiles' canopies don't mesh.

**Fix:** Extend biome feature rendering to cover the full tile slot (not just the hex interior).

- [x] **16C.1 — Full-slot feature scattering** — `scatter_features_fullslot()` in `biome_scatter.py`. Expands sampling area by `overscan` fraction on each side (default 15%), scattering via Poisson disk on the enlarged rectangle. Feature positions are in tile-local coords (may be negative or exceed tile_size). 8 tests in `test_biome_scatter.py`: features outside tile bounds, more than standard, proportional to area, deterministic, neighbour density affects margin, zero density empty, density continuity at boundary.

- [x] **16C.2 — Neighbour-seeded margin features** — `scatter_features_fullslot()` accepts `neighbour_densities` and `neighbour_seeds` dicts. The spatial density function uses neighbour density values for features in the margin zone (outside `[0, tile_size]`), ensuring cross-boundary feature coherence.

- [x] **16C.3 — Feature-level cross-fade** — `render_forest_on_ground_fullslot()` in `biome_render.py`. Accepts optional `blend_mask` (from 16B). Composites featured image with ground image: `output = ground * (1-mask) + featured * mask`, so features fade toward ground at tile edges. `ForestRenderer` in `biome_pipeline.py` gains `fullslot=True` mode. 5 tests in `test_biome_render.py`: produces image, with blend mask, mask fades edges, no-mask mode, deterministic.

- [x] **16C.4 — Tests:** 13 new tests total:
  - `TestScatterFeaturesFullslot` (8): outside bounds, count comparison, area-proportional, deterministic, neighbour density, zero density, boundary continuity
  - `TestRenderForestOnGroundFullslot` (5): image output, blend mask, edge fade, no-mask, deterministic

### 16D — Hex Shape Softening ✅

**Problem:** The hex sub-face grid creates a visible hexagonal structure in the texture — concentric rings of faces with slightly different sizes/colours.

**Fix:** Break up the hex grid pattern at the rendering level.

- [x] **16D.1 — Sub-face edge dissolution** — `jitter_polygon_vertices()` in `tile_texture.py`. Per-vertex deterministic jitter (±1.5 px default) seeded from vertex position hash + noise_seed. Integrated into `render_detail_texture_fullslot()` via `vertex_jitter` parameter. 4 tests: bounds check, zero jitter passthrough, determinism, seed sensitivity.

- [x] **16D.2 — Pixel-level noise overlay** — `apply_noise_overlay()` in `tile_texture.py`. FBM noise (3 octaves, frequency 0.05 px⁻¹, amplitude ±5%) applied as multiplicative brightness shift `pixel * (1 + noise)`. Applied after IDW background fill so all pixels get micro-variation. 5 tests: shape/dtype, pixel changes, amplitude bounds, determinism, seed sensitivity.

- [x] **16D.3 — Sub-face colour dithering** — `apply_colour_dithering()` in `tile_texture.py`. KDTree-based IDW blend of K nearest sub-face colours. Blend factor ramps from 0 at centroid to 0.5 at `blend_radius` distance. Applied before IDW background fill (only polygon-covered pixels). Sentinel pixels skipped. 4 tests: shape/dtype, sentinel preservation, centre-vs-edge change, boundary contrast reduction.

- [x] **16D.4 — Tests:** 17 new tests in `test_tile_texture.py`:
  - `TestJitterPolygonVertices` (4): within ±2px, zero passthrough, deterministic, seed-sensitive
  - `TestApplyNoiseOverlay` (5): shape, pixel changes, amplitude < 15%, deterministic, seed-sensitive
  - `TestApplyColourDithering` (4): shape, sentinel preserved, centre < edge change, boundary contrast reduced
  - `TestFullslotWith16D` (4): all-on, all-off, enhanced ≠ plain, deterministic with enhancements

### 16E — Pipeline Integration & Validation ✅

Wire all the 16A–D improvements into the production rendering pipeline.

- [x] **16E.1 — Pipeline flags** — added `soft_blend` and `blend_fade_width` parameters to `build_feature_atlas()` in `biome_pipeline.py`. When `soft_blend=True`: forces fullslot rendering (16A+16D), computes per-tile blend masks (16B), gathers neighbour densities/seeds for fullslot scatter (16C), passes blend masks to `ForestRenderer`, and applies `apply_blend_mask_to_atlas()` to the assembled atlas. Added `--soft-blend` CLI flag to both `view_globe_v3.py` and `demo_forest_globe.py`. Default: off (backward compatible).

- [x] **16E.2 — Script integration** — `view_globe_v3.py` branches on `--soft-blend` to call `build_feature_atlas()` with `soft_blend=True` instead of `build_detail_atlas()`. `demo_forest_globe.py` passes `soft_blend` through `_build_feature_atlas()` to `build_feature_atlas()` and creates `ForestRenderer(fullslot=soft_blend)`.

- [x] **16E.5 — Tests:** 8 new tests in `TestSoftBlendPipeline` (`test_biome_pipeline.py`):
  - `test_soft_blend_atlas_produces_file` — end-to-end produces valid PNG
  - `test_soft_blend_atlas_dimensions_unchanged` — same size as plain atlas
  - `test_soft_blend_with_forest_features` — works with forest overlays
  - `test_soft_blend_forces_fullslot` — no magenta sentinel pixels
  - `test_soft_blend_alters_tile_edges` — measurable edge difference
  - `test_soft_blend_uv_values_in_range` — UV coords valid [0,1]
  - `test_blend_fade_width_parameter` — different widths produce different results
  - `test_soft_blend_partial_density` — partial density map accepted

### Summary — Phase 16 Implementation Order

| Step | Focus | Problem Solved | Complexity |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| **16A** | Full-slot texture rendering | Flat-fill background outside hex polygons | Medium |
| **16B** | Soft edge blending mask | Hard tile boundaries | Medium |
| **16C** | Feature overflow + neighbour seeding | Canopy clipped at tile edges | Medium |
| **16D** | Hex shape softening | Visible hexagonal sub-face grid | Low |
| **16E** | Pipeline integration | End-to-end wiring + validation | Low |

### Design notes — Why not stitch neighbour detail grids for rendering?

The alternative approach — stitching adjacent tiles' detail grids into a combined grid (as `region_stitch.py` does for terrain generation in 11C) and rendering the combined grid's texture — would give perfect cross-tile continuity. However:

1. **Rendering cost:** Each tile would need to render its own sub-faces *plus* a ring of neighbour sub-faces (6 neighbours × ~20 boundary faces each = ~120 extra faces). For 92 tiles, that's ~11,000 extra face renders per atlas build.
2. **Complexity:** The stitched grid exists in projected 2D space (gnomonic). Rendering it back to the tile's texture space requires coordinate transforms, clipping, and careful UV mapping.
3. **Diminishing returns:** The extended-rendering + soft-blending approach (16A+16B) achieves 90% of the visual improvement at 20% of the implementation complexity. The remaining 10% (sub-pixel-perfect cross-tile continuity) is invisible at normal globe viewing distances.

If the soft-blending approach proves insufficient after implementation, stitched neighbour rendering can be added as a 16F extension.

## Phase 17 — Ocean Biome Rendering 🔲

**Goal:** Transform ocean tiles from flat blue fills into convincing bodies of water with depth gradients, surface texture, wave patterns, coastal transitions, and atmosphere interaction — all rendered into tile textures and enhanced by the shader pipeline. The ocean should look as rich as the forest biome, just for water.

### Problem analysis

Current ocean rendering (Phase 13H) operates entirely in the fragment shader:
- `classify_water_tiles()` detects ocean tiles by blue-channel dominance
- The PBR shader replaces water tile colours with a `WATER_SHALLOW → WATER_DEEP` gradient based on depth
- Animated wave normals perturb the surface (`sin`/`cos` via `u_time`)
- Coastline foam uses `dFdx`/`dFdy` of the water flag

This gives a functional but simplistic ocean: uniform blue tiles with a slight animated shimmer. It lacks:
- **Depth-based colour gradients** baked into tile textures (not just shader-time)
- **Surface texture** — subtle wave/ripple patterns at the texture level
- **Coastal features** — surf lines, shallow-water sand/reef visibility, tidal patterns
- **Deep ocean features** — darker blue-black, abyssal colour, occasional lighter patches (upwelling)
- **Ice/polar** — different water appearance at high latitudes

### Architecture: Texture-Level + Shader-Level

Like forests, ocean rendering needs two layers:
1. **Texture layer** — ocean tile textures are rendered with depth-based colours, surface patterns, coastal detail, and feature placement. These are baked into the atlas alongside terrain/forest tiles.
2. **Shader layer** — the existing 13H water shader is enhanced with better animations, specular reflections, and Fresnel effects that operate on top of the textured ocean tiles.

### Planning Session — Key Design Decisions

> **These decisions need careful evaluation before implementation begins. Phase 17 tasks are preliminary — they will be refined during a dedicated planning session once Phase 16 is complete.**

#### Decision 1: OceanRenderer vs. enhanced ground colouring

**Option A — `OceanRenderer` implementing `BiomeRenderer`:** Like `ForestRenderer`, a dedicated renderer class that takes the ground texture and overlays ocean features (waves, depth, caustics) via PIL rendering. Plugs into `build_feature_atlas()`.

**Option B — Enhanced colour ramp + shader:** Keep ocean rendering primarily shader-based (13H) but improve the colour ramp baked into tile textures by `detail_render.py`. Add depth gradients and coastal features to the colour ramp itself.

**Likely answer: Option A for texture features + enhanced Option B for shader.** The ocean needs both baked detail (texture) and animated effects (shader). The `BiomeRenderer` protocol was designed for exactly this — `OceanRenderer.render()` produces the ocean texture, then the shader adds animation.

#### Decision 2: Ocean depth model

Where does "depth" come from? Options:
- **Elevation-based:** tiles with elevation < `water_level` are ocean. Depth = `water_level - elevation`. Simple, already available.
- **Distance-from-coast:** compute distance (in tile hops) from nearest land tile. Deeper = further from land. Gives natural depth gradients but needs a BFS pass.
- **Hybrid:** base depth from elevation, modulated by distance-from-coast for realistic continental shelf gradients.

#### Decision 3: Coastal transition quality

The land-ocean boundary is the most visually critical zone. Options:
- **Per-pixel transition:** render coastal tiles with a gradient from land colours to ocean colours based on sub-face elevation. Already partially done by 10C's water_level colour ramp.
- **Surf/foam overlay:** add white surf lines along the coast using edge detection on the water mask.
- **Shallow water transparency:** coastal ocean tiles show the seabed colour blended with water colour based on depth (shallow = more seabed visible).

#### Decision 4: Interaction with Phase 16 soft blending

Ocean tiles border land tiles. Phase 16's soft edge blending (16B) will cross-fade ocean and land textures at boundaries. This must look correct — the fade zone should produce a natural beach/coast gradient, not a murky green-blue blend. May need special-case handling for ocean↔land boundaries.

### 17A — Ocean Feature Configuration ✅

- [x] **17A.1 — `OceanFeatureConfig` dataclass** in `ocean_render.py` — frozen dataclass with 14 tuneable parameters: `shallow_color`, `deep_color`, `abyssal_color`, `coastal_foam_color`, `sand_color`, `depth_gradient_power`, `wave_frequency`, `wave_amplitude`, `foam_width`, `caustic_frequency`, `caustic_strength`, `ice_latitude_threshold`, `reef_probability`, `density_scale`. Four presets: `TROPICAL_OCEAN`, `TEMPERATE_OCEAN`, `ARCTIC_OCEAN`, `DEEP_OCEAN` in `OCEAN_PRESETS` dict.

- [x] **17A.2 — `compute_ocean_depth_map()`** — hybrid elevation + BFS-distance depth. Multi-source BFS seeds from all land tiles bordering ocean. `elevation_weight`/`distance_weight` control the mix. Also: `identify_ocean_tiles()` (like `identify_forest_tiles` for ocean) and `compute_coast_direction()` (unit 3D vector toward nearest land).

- [x] **17A.3 — Tests:** 19 tests in `test_ocean_render.py`:
  - `TestOceanFeatureConfig` (7): defaults valid, presets exist, valid colours, positive frequencies, shallow brighter than deep, frozen, custom config
  - `TestIdentifyOceanTiles` (3): finds ocean, no ocean, custom terrain type
  - `TestComputeOceanDepthMap` (7): all ocean tiles present, values [0,1], land not in map, coastal < deep, empty set, all-ocean, elevation-weight dominance
  - `TestComputeCoastDirection` (2): coastal has unit vector, deep ocean returns None

### 17B — Ocean Texture Rendering (`ocean_render.py`) ✅

Pixel-level rendering of ocean features onto tile textures.

- [x] **17B.1 — `render_ocean_depth_gradient()`** — fills tile with depth-dependent colour gradient. Three-stop interpolation (shallow→deep→abyssal) controlled by `depth_gradient_power`. Low-frequency FBM noise (±8% depth perturbation) for spatial variation. 4 tests: shallow brighter than deep, not flat, zero-depth ≈ shallow_color, deterministic.

- [x] **17B.2 — `render_wave_pattern()`** — baked wave overlay. Dual sinusoidal ridges (horizontal + diagonal) with FBM noise modulation. Amplitude attenuated by depth (deep = 0.2× shallow). Brightness variation ±4%. 4 tests: modifies pixels, variance, deep calmer, deterministic.

- [x] **17B.3 — `render_coastal_features()`** — foam, sand, caustics, reefs for `depth < 0.3`. Coast direction projects to 2D for edge-localised effects. Foam band with noise breakup. Shallow sand blend at `depth < 0.1`. Caustic sin×sin pattern at `depth < 0.2`. Reef patches via `_render_reef_patches()` (probability-gated). 4 tests: modifies shallow, skips deep, foam brighter near coast, None direction ok.

- [x] **17B.4 — `render_deep_ocean_features()`** — abyssal darkening (up to 25%) + subtle upwelling lighter patches via FBM. Active only when `depth > 0.5`. 3 tests: darkened, shallow unmodified, very deep < medium.

- [x] **17B.5 — `render_ocean_tile()` composite** — applies all four layers in order (gradient → waves → coastal → deep). Returns RGB copy. Also: `_depth_color()`, `_lerp_color()` helpers. 5 tests: RGB output, shallow vs deep brightness, differs from input, deterministic, seed-sensitive.

- [x] **17B.6 — Tests:** 20 new tests in `test_ocean_render.py` (total 39 including 17A).

### 17C — Ocean Pipeline Integration ✅

Wire the ocean renderer into the biome pipeline.

- [x] **17C.1 — `OceanRenderer` class** — implements `BiomeRenderer`:
  1. Look up tile's ocean depth from the depth map
  2. Determine coast direction (from neighbour land/ocean classification)
  3. Render depth gradient → wave pattern → coastal/deep features
  4. Return composited image

- [x] **17C.2 — Biome pipeline registration** — register `OceanRenderer` alongside `ForestRenderer` in `build_feature_atlas()`:
  - Added `biome_type_map` parameter: `{face_id: "forest"|"ocean"|...}`
  - `_get_renderer(fid)` routes each tile to the correct renderer
  - Backward compatible: if no map provided, falls back to first renderer

- [x] **17C.3 — Land-ocean boundary handling** — special logic for Phase 16's soft blending at ocean↔land boundaries:
  - OceanRenderer accepts blend_mask from 16B pipeline
  - Cross-fade between ground texture and ocean render via mask
  - Coast direction computed from globe adjacency for oriented foam/sand

- [x] **17C.4 — Tests:** 9 new tests in `test_biome_pipeline.py`:
  - TestOceanRenderer: protocol conformance, image output, pixel changes, depth map effect
  - TestOceanPipelineIntegration: ocean-only atlas, mixed forest+ocean, visual difference, biome_type_map routing, land tiles unaffected

### 17D — Shader Enhancements 🔲

Upgrade the existing 13H water shader to work with the new textured ocean tiles.

- [ ] **17D.1 — Texture-aware water shader** — the PBR fragment shader currently replaces water tile colours entirely. Update it to *enhance* the baked ocean texture instead:
  - Sample the atlas texture (which now has depth gradients, waves, etc.)
  - Add animated wave normal perturbation on top (existing 13H)
  - Add specular reflection enhancement (water is more reflective than land)
  - Preserve the baked depth gradient and coastal features

- [ ] **17D.2 — Fresnel-based reflection** — enhance water Fresnel:
  - At glancing angles (near globe edge): water is highly reflective (sky-coloured)
  - At steep angles (looking straight down): water is transparent (shows baked texture)
  - Uses existing Schlick approximation but with water-specific IOR

- [ ] **17D.3 — Sun specular hotspot** — bright specular reflection of the sun on the water surface:
  - Position moves with globe rotation
  - Size controlled by roughness (calm water = tight hotspot, rough = broad)
  - Only on water tiles (use water_flag)

- [ ] **17D.4 — Tests:**
  - Shader source contains texture sampling before water colour override
  - Fresnel keywords present in shader
  - Specular hotspot code present
  - Backward compatibility: shader still works with untextured water tiles

### 17E — Ocean Globe Demo & Tuning 🔲

- [ ] **17E.1 — Ocean-focused terrain presets:**
  - `OCEAN_WORLD` — 80% ocean, scattered island chains (ideal for ocean demo)
  - `ARCHIPELAGO_OCEAN` — existing archipelago preset with enhanced ocean features
  - Update existing presets to enable ocean rendering by default

- [ ] **17E.2 — Demo script `scripts/demo_ocean_globe.py`:**
  - `python scripts/demo_ocean_globe.py -f 3 --detail-rings 4 --preset ocean_world --view`
  - Shows ocean depth gradients, coastal features, wave patterns, sun reflections

- [ ] **17E.3 — Visual tuning** — iterate on:
  - Depth gradient colour stops for convincing ocean-from-space look
  - Wave pattern scale relative to tile size
  - Coastal foam width and brightness
  - Deep vs shallow ocean contrast
  - Interaction with atmosphere shader (ocean should be slightly hazier near horizon)

- [ ] **17E.4 — Combined biome demo** — globe with forests on land AND oceans with depth:
  - `python scripts/demo_ocean_globe.py -f 3 --detail-rings 4 --preset earthlike --features --view`
  - The "money shot": a full planet with rich forests, varied terrain, and detailed oceans

- [ ] **17E.5 — Tests:**
  - Ocean-world globe renders without error
  - All ocean tiles have non-uniform pixel colours (not flat blue)
  - Combined forest + ocean globe renders correctly
  - Performance: atlas build with ocean + forest < 3× baseline

### Summary — Phase 17 Implementation Order

| Step | Module | Depends on | Delivers | Complexity |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **17A** | `ocean_render.py` (config) | 13H water classification | Config, depth map | Low |
| **17B** | `ocean_render.py` (rendering) | 17A | Pixel-level ocean textures | Medium |
| **17C** | `biome_pipeline.py` (ocean) | 17B + 16B (soft blend) | Pipeline integration | Medium |
| **17D** | `globe_renderer_v2.py` (shader) | 17C + 13E (PBR) | Enhanced water shader | Medium |
| **17E** | demo + tuning | 17A–D | End-to-end ocean demo | Low |

### Design notes — Texture vs. shader rendering for ocean

Most game engines render water entirely in shaders (animated normals, reflection mapping, Fresnel). Our approach differs because:

1. **We're rendering a globe from space**, not a close-up water surface. At globe scale, ocean detail is subtle — depth gradients, colour zones, coastal features. These are static and better baked into textures.
2. **The biome pipeline is texture-based.** Forest features are baked into tile textures. Ocean features should use the same pipeline for consistency and code reuse.
3. **Shader effects complement textures.** The animated waves, specular, and Fresnel from 13H add life to the baked ocean textures. It's a two-layer system: baked detail + real-time animation.

### Design notes — Interaction between Phase 16 and Phase 17

Phase 16's soft edge blending (16B) affects ocean↔land boundaries. The blend zone between an ocean tile and a land tile should produce a natural coastal gradient:
- Ocean side: shallow turquoise → sandy coast
- Land side: coastal vegetation → sandy beach

This requires 17C.3 (land-ocean boundary handling) to work with 16B's blend mask. The order of operations:
1. Render land tile texture (terrain + forest features via 16A)
2. Render ocean tile texture (depth + waves + coastal via 17B)
3. Apply Phase 16 blend mask → cross-fade produces coastal gradient
4. Shader adds animation on top

If the automatic cross-fade doesn't produce a good coastal look, 17C.3 can add explicit coastal colours to the blend zone.

| 17 (Ocean Biome) | None (extends existing biome_pipeline + shader infra) |
